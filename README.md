## Abstract

I am going to use big GAN to develop images of some Future Wonders of the World. I will plug in some absract descriptions of what I imagine these seven future wonders could be. I would definitely like to further develop this concept into some fictional travel booklets or something in the future.

## Model/Data

I used BigGAN text to image

## Code
